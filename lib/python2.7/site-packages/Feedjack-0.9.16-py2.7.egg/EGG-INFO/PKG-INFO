Description: 
        Feedjack is a feed aggregator writen in Python using the Django web development
        framework.
        
        Like the Planet feed aggregator:
        
            * It downloads feeds and aggregate their contents in a single site
            * The new aggregated site has a feed of its own (atom and rss)
            * It uses Mark Pilgrim’s excelent FeedParser
            * The subscriber list can be exported as OPML and FOAF
        
        But FeedJack also has some advantages:
        
            * It handles historical data, you can read old posts
            * It parses a lot more info, including post categories
            * It generates pages with posts of a certain category
            * It generates pages with posts from a certain subscriber
            * It generates pages with posts of a certain category from a certain
               subcriber
            * A cloud tag/folksonomy (hype 2.0 compliant) for every page and every
              subscriber
            * It uses Django templates
            * The administration is done via web (using Django's kickass autogenerated
              and magical admin site), and can handle multiple planets
            * Extensive use of django’s internal cache engine. Most of the time you
              will have no database hits when serving pages.
